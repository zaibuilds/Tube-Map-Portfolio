    <p><strong>Problem:</strong>
      <br>
      <br>
      Users struggle to find reliable skincare and information advice directly from one source alongside struggling to maintain consistency in a skincare routine

      <strong>Intro:</strong>
      <br>
      <br>
      Oracle was an idea I had just under a year ago that never came to fruition. I was struggling with acne at the time and thought an app helping to find reliable skincare advice and track my skincare routine would be of great help. This year (2021) I decided to develop this idea. 
      <br>
      <br>
      <strong>Process</strong>
      <br>
      <br>
      For the project I decided to utilise the human centred design approach; Empathise, Define, Ideate, Prototype, Test.
      <br><br>
     <strong>Research</strong>
     <br>
     <br>
     My initial hope for this project was to find that 75% of users would use my product. After conducting interviews with 20 participants, I discovered that 90% of users interviewed would be interested in a social media app for skincare lovers.

    Alongside completing this feasibility study I delved deeper into analysing userâ€™s habits. I chose to focus on 4 main areas of interest.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<strong>Issues users faced when purchasing skincare products online or otherwise</strong>
<br>
<br>
<strong>Where users looked for skincare product information</strong>
<br>
<br>
<strong>Where users looked for skincare advice</strong>
<br>
<br>
<strong>Did users use social media to find skincare product recommendations? If yes, what did they use?</strong>

    <p>
      <strong>13 users reported 1 or more issues with purchasing skincare 
      </strong>
      <br>
      <br>
      <strong>5 users reported stock availability as being an issue when purchasing skincare products online </strong>
      <br>
      <br>
      <strong>2 users reported being unable to test products in person as being an issue with purchasing skincare online, 1 of these 2 users said this was especially an issue when purchasing sunscreen due to white cast </strong>
      <br>
      <br>
      <strong>2 users reported being unsure of how to implement a product in a routine as being an issue</strong>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      Other issues users reported were products not living up to expectations, inconsistent reviews, product efficacy and finding products suitable for their skin type
