    <p><strong>Problem:</strong>

      <strong>Intro:</strong>
      <br>
      <br>
      Oracle was an idea I had just under a year ago that never came to fruition. I was struggling with acne at the time and thought an app helping to find reliable skincare advice and track my skincare routine would be of great help. This year (2021) I decided to develop this idea. 
      <br>
      <br>
      <strong>Process</strong>
      <br>
      <br>
      For the project I decided to utilise the human centred design approach; Empathise, Define, Ideate, Prototype, Test.
      <br><br>
     <strong>Research</strong>
     <br>
     <br>
     My initial hope for this project was to find that 75% of users would use my product. After conducting interviews with 20 participants, I discovered that 90% of users interviewed would be interested in a social media app for skincare lovers.

    Alongside completing this feasibility study I delved deeper into analysing userâ€™s habits. I chose to focus on 4 main areas of interest.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<em>Issues users faced when purchasing skincare products online or otherwise</em>
<br>
<br>
<em>Where users looked for skincare product information</em>
<br>
<br>
<em>Where users looked for skincare advice</em>
<br>
<br>
<em>Did users use social media to find skincare product recommendations? If yes, what did they use?</em>

      <em>2 users reported being unable to test products in person as being an issue with purchasing skincare online, 1 of these 2 users said this was especially an issue when purchasing sunscreen due to white cast </em>

      <em>2 users reported being unsure of how to implement a product in a routine as being an issue</em>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      Other issues users reported were products not living up to expectations, inconsistent reviews, product efficacy and finding products suitable for their skin type

      Alongside collecting data on user habits, I also received some valuable data regarding what Oracle should contain. One of my initial ideas was to implement tracking and also data insights, similar to Flo, within the app to aid users with maintaining consistency in their skincare routine as well as track skin issues. 2 participants echoed implementing these features.
      <br>
      <br>
      Additionally, in regards to implementing a tracking feature, 16 users said an app with this feature would benefit them. 
<br>
<br>
<strong>Ideation</strong>
<br>
<br>
For my ideation, I decided to create mind maps detailing which features Oracle could potentially incorporate. Alongside this I also created some low fidelity sketches of a few of the screens.
