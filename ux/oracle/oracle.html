    <p><strong>Problem:</strong>
      <br>
      <br>
      Users struggle to find reliable skincare information and advice directly from one source alongside struggling to maintain consistency in a skincare routine

      10 Days

      <strong>Intro:</strong>
      <br>
      <br>
      Oracle was an idea I had just under a year ago that never came to fruition. I was struggling with acne at the time and thought an app helping to find reliable skincare advice and track my skincare routine would be of great help. This year (2021) I decided to develop this idea. 
      <br>
      <br>
      <strong>Process</strong>
      <br>
      <br>
      For the project I decided to utilise the human centred design approach; Empathise, Define, Ideate, Prototype, Test.
      <br><br>
     <strong>Research</strong>
     <br>
     <br>
     My initial hope for this project was to find that 75% of users would use my product. After conducting interviews with 20 participants, I discovered that 90% of users interviewed would be interested in a social media app for skincare lovers.

    Alongside completing this feasibility study I delved deeper into analysing userâ€™s habits. I chose to focus on 4 main areas of interest.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<em>Issues users faced when purchasing skincare products online or otherwise</em>
<br>
<br>
<em>Where users looked for skincare product information</em>
<br>
<br>
<em>Where users looked for skincare advice</em>
<br>
<br>
<em>Did users use social media to find skincare product recommendations? If yes, what did they use?</em>

<strong>Issues users faced when purchasing skincare products online or otherwise</strong>

      <br>
      <br>
      <em>2 users reported being unable to test products in person as being an issue with purchasing skincare online, 1 of these 2 users said this was especially an issue when purchasing sunscreen due to white cast </em>

      <br>
      <em>2 users reported being unsure of how to implement a product in a routine as being an issue</em>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      Other issues users reported were products not living up to expectations, inconsistent reviews, product efficacy and finding products suitable for their skin type.

      Alongside collecting data on user habits, I also received some valuable data regarding what Oracle should contain. One of my initial ideas was to implement tracking and also data insights, similar to Flo, within the app to aid users with maintaining consistency in their skincare routine as well as track skin issues. 2 participants echoed implementing these features.
      <br>
      <br>
      Additionally, in regards to implementing a tracking feature, 16 users said an app with this feature would benefit them. 
<br>
<br>
<strong>Ideation</strong>
<br>
<br>
For my ideation, I decided to create mind maps detailing which features Oracle could potentially incorporate. Alongside this I also created some low fidelity sketches of a few of the screens.

      <strong>Design</strong>
      <br>
      <br>
      After deciding which features to include and completing my low fidelity sketches, I created some mid fidelity wireframes in Figma.

      After creating mid-fidelity wireframes, I decided to make a series of style guides and then create my initial high-fidelity wireframe.

      I decided to use Montserrat as it is a Sans-serif font and accessible for neurodiverse users and those with visual impairments.
<br>
<br>
The colour palette I used is largely monochrome; resulting in it being gender neutral. This results in a larger potential market as opposed to if the colour palette was more feminine.
<br>
<br>
One design decision I was uncertain of was the design of the navigation bar. In order to make a decision I conducted an A/B test, as can be seen below. After making this decision I then completed the remainder of the high-fidelity wireframe.

      <strong>Prototyping</strong>
      <br>
      <br>
      After completing high-fidelity wireframes I completed the first prototype of the design, as can be seen below:
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="prototype">
    <iframe style="border: 1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);" width="800" height="450" src="https://www.figma.com/embed?embed_host=share&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.figma.com%2Fproto%2FUMNhdADZo8FmaSV5VFXyMj%2FOracle-Initial-Prototype%3Fpage-id%3D0%253A1%26node-id%3D0%253A34%26viewport%3D475%252C348%252C0.11%26scaling%3Dscale-down%26starting-point-node-id%3D0%253A6" allowfullscreen></iframe>
  </div>

  <div class="copy">
    <p>
      <strong>Testing</strong>
      <br>
      <br>
      After creating this prototype, I underwent usability testing with 6 users to pick up on any potential pain points or issues users had when using the prototype.
      <br>
      <br>
      My usability testing process was the following;
      <br>
      <br>
      * Asking users to perform a series of tasks on the prototype
      <br>
      <br>
      * Recording whether users completed these tasks successfully or not
      <br>
      <br>
      * Asking users to rate the difficulty of each task on a scale of 1â€“5 (1 being the lowest and 5 being the highest)
      <br>
      <br>
      * Upon completion of the test; asking users for any additional comments, questions or suggestions
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      The feedback I received from users was largely positive; with all participants enjoying the product overall and scoring 1â€“2 for most tasks. However, there were some issues.
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      These issues were:
      <br>
      <br>
      * Confusion between the â€˜Create Postâ€™ button and â€˜Log Entryâ€™ button in the navigation bar
      <br>
      <br>
      * Messages icon in the navigation bar being slightly ambiguous due to the icon I chose to use
       <br>
       <br>
      * Awkward positioning of â€˜Create Postâ€™ button
        <br>
        <br>
      * Scrollable areas not being clear enough
      <br>
      <br>
      * Calendar placement on â€˜Log Entryâ€™ page causing user confusion
      <br>
      <br>
      * â€˜Edit Profileâ€™ button is aesthetically unappealing
      <br>
      <br>
      * Colours in pie and bar chart not being clear enough
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <strong>Iteration</strong>
      <br>
      <br>
      After discovering these problems, I decided to iterate my initial prototype and resolve them.
    </p>

      <strong>What I learned:</strong>
      <br>
      <br>
      The value of collecting both quantitative and qualitative data when conducting research, how to conduct user interviews and also how to conduct usability testing.
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <strong>What I did:</strong>
      <br>
      <br>
      * Implemented features influenced by insights from data that I collected; such as user verification, a social feed and the tracking feature
      <br>
      <br>
      * Conducted user interviews and usability testing
     <br>
     <br>
     * Considered factors such as accessibility, user retention and time on task in my initial design process
     <br>
     <br>
     * Iterated my design upon receiving feedback
    <br>
    <br>
    * Created an accessible, functional product
    <br>
